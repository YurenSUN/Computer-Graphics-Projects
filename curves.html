  <p>
    For the color, I made two lines (or curves) with sin and cos functions. I changed the geometry where the geometry is higher for position on the lines. I used a diffuse light to the front and a specular light rotation around.
  </p>
  <p>
    For animation, I let the sphere rotate with the speed uniform giving from the js file; let the pattern on the square move based on the speed uniform; let the specular light rotate aound the square and sphere clockwisely.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>I added some sliders to control the colors and animation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Period controls the number of period for the sin and cos curves. The larger the period, the denser the curves are.</li>
      <li>Pairs controls the number of pairs of curves on the square or sphere.</li>
      <li>Height controls how high the position will be from the orginal sphere if it is on the curve.</li>
      <li>Shine controls the shinness of the specular light as the example provided by the instructors.</li>
      <li>Speed controls the rotation speed for the sphere or curve moving speed for the square.</li>
      <li>Zero Speed button sets the speed to zero.</li>
    </ul>
